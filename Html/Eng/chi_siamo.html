            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
              We are <strong>Alex</strong> and <strong>Giuseppe</strong>, born and raised in <strong>Matera</strong>, and we deeply love our city.
              For study and work reasons, over the last <strong>10 years</strong> we've had the opportunity to live in countries such as Lithuania, 
              France, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, and to enjoy unforgettable moments in vibrant Italian cities like Turin and Milan.
            </p>

            <p>
              Every return to Matera is a return to our <strong>roots</strong>: 
              an emotional rebirth in what we call our <strong>"home of the heart"</strong>. 
              Together with our friends, we organize personalized tours through the ancient streets of Matera, 
              revealing hidden corners, stories, and unique traditions.
            </p>

            <p>
                We believe these <strong>experiences</strong> should be shared and reserved for those who, like us, 
                wish to experience Matera in an authentic and profound way. From this spirit of sharing and the desire 
                to help our loved ones discover the city, the idea of the <strong>Matera City Pass</strong> was born.
            </p>
